Obligatory first post:  
```
Hello, World.
```

I've chosen to follow the GitHub masses and publish this blog with
Brandon Mathis' most excellent [Octopress](http://octopress.org).
Next on the agenda is to port a number of my wiki notes and how-to's
to a more ... revision controlled outlet: GitHub.

Stay tuned - Eric
